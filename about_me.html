    <h1>I'm Fabio.</h1>

        In my spare time you can find me doing sports. I really love trail running and swimming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really like to read. Nothing in specific. From mathematics to non fiction stories. In any of my 4 preferred languages 🇮🇹🇬🇧🇪🇸🇵🇹
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm drawn to human connection. I really thrive when learning about people and new cultures. That's why I travel a lot. When I travel I try to have genuine experiences. Getting to know locals and spending time in non famous spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why I really like photography. (especially film cameras) Love the can't know how the picture I took came out but I captured a special moment. When I develop rolls I truly have a special time remembering meaningful moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like writing. Sometimes I write poetry. Not very good at it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning how to play the guitar. How to sail and how to dive.
      </p>

      <p><strong>If I could summarize in a general way what I do:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Executing my learnings with tools that let me craft my ideas into reality. Leveraging AI; to study computer science, mathematics, statistics, languages
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Certainly not an expert in any of these topics. Nor dedicating all my time to one topic in specific. Constant search for a combination of all - into a one whole crafted specialty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life's completeness is too fun to obsess over one thing only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trying to deliver impact and go 100% when I commit to something though. This is very critical for me and main self-evaluation when taking on new projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to measure the human-side of impact as well. Economical tangibles are a required must but there are hidden metrics I usually really like to understand.

        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Everything on this will be always be written by me. No AI, not because I'm a hater but because I want to conserve my human mistakes and truly depict my thoughts in a natural way. So this might not be the most well-written compelling poetry.
