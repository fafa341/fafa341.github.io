    <h1>CFA LATAM Report: Learnings</h1>
    <p><em>Comprehensive Analysis of Latin American Markets</em></p>

    <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
    <p>
      Teamwork was key in this. Aligning responsibilities and deadlines was critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      For finance usually techniques for evaluating companies that have been working for the past 30 years work well now.
    </p>
    <p>
      For tool usage the simpler the better. Linear regression does wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep research tool with Gemini is key to get access to deeper insights + intuition and field knowledge. That's the combo: uncover how the macro works and tie it to the micro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exceptional experience to learn how to tie qualitative aspects move quantitative details and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exceptional risk analysis is achieved when context about company history, industry and competition is fully gathered and understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trying to predict the finance market is not reliable with no sufficient information.
    </p>

    <h2>Market Insights</h2>
    <p>
      It's interesting to see how loyalty programs are a priority for most companies. Delivering a unique experience has never been that important. Must understand their users for this. Really well.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      Gathering data was quite hard not because of insufficient information but irrelevant information. Learned how to detect truly useful information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had a good experience with Bloomberg terminal. Learning curve is not steep. Quite simple actually. I can see how to leverage this especially with specific automation pipelines if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Power of synthesis and communication. Every technical or major discovery is useless unless we can communicate its impact. Learned how to communicate effectively.
    </p>
